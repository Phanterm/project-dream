*Project Dream*, a working title for our *Phantom Dust* VRC game project.

## Goals
- Create a highly expressive 2v2 projectile-based deckbuilding action game.
- Bring the theorycrafting, card-drawing experience of the original Xbox game to the VR environment.
- Make it easy for users to change settings and set up games in different modes from a lobby system.
- Ship with the minimum number of cards & skills to make for reasonable scope that allows complexity and player expression.
