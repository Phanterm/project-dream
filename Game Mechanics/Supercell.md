Storms that form on the map at a random location at least two cells away from either team's spawn point. In all other game modes, the Supercell may spawn anywhere.

### Conditions
After a certain period of time in a match, the Supercell will appear, indicated by a large storm. 

### Effects
Wherever the Supercell appears, a special set of [[Draw Zones]] will become active and can be used by a player or team that occupies that quadrant.

If a player or team manages to occupy the Supercell area for long enough, the Supercell dissipates, but the [[Draw Zones]] there become permanent and will belong to the one who claimed it. They may also receive other bonuses.

So long as two or more opposing players occupy the Supercell, it cannot be claimed!
