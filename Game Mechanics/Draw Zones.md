Draw Zones are small interactable objects that appear on the map in random or predefined locations, usually in sets of 2 or 3. 

Highlighting or hovering over the Draw Zone will tell you the card information. Your slots will glow while highlighting to indicate free slots/you can add the card to your [[Deck Zone]].

To draw a card from a Draw Zone, the player can either click on the Draw Zone to assign it to any random open slot in your [[Deck Zone]], or pull a card from it directly and place it in the desired free slot.

(Letting go of the card will cancel the draw and return the card to the Draw Zone.)

When a card is drawn from a Draw Zone, it is inert for 20 seconds. After 20 seconds, the Draw Zone will regenerate, containing a new card "drawn" from your deck.
