After the player has drawn every card in their deck at least once, their Draw Zones will begin to look corrupted, indicating that the player is in an exhausted state. 

From this point on, the player will lose 4 HP a minute (every 15 seconds). The player may die this way.

This is the equivalent of being "milled" or "decked out" in a card game, and represents a situation where defeat is almost certain.
