Your Deck Zone is where your [[Card]] are located in order to reference.

Your Deck Zone has two Quick Slots, binding that skill to Left Trigger or Right Trigger, respectively. 
*(must account for keyboard users and an alt-fire mode)*

The other two slots require you to draw the card from your Deck Zone. Once the drawn card leaves the immediate radius of the Deck Zone, the card is consumed and the skill is automatically cast.

Selecting any card you have equipped will display that card's stats while your cursor remains in the Deck Zone radius.
