Players draw their Skills from a [[Deck]] of 30 cards.


### In-Game
Cards are picked up from [[Draw Zones]] and manifest as usable abilities in the player's [[Deck Zone]].

## Card Types
### Normal
Changes player stats on use. Mana cards, environmental cards, etc. Simple with generic animations.

## Direct
Tracks locked in targets. Mechanism for firing and tracking target based on various supported ranges.

## Point,
Manually placed on the map; cannot be locked on. Mechanism for providing spawn zone hint and then spawning the spell there.

## Indirect
Cannot target enemies, and are not manually placed. These are buffs, and untargeted attacks.
