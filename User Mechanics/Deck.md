Decks contain up to 30 [[Card]]s.

### Deck Types

### In-Game
[[Card]]s are acquired from [[Draw Zones]] that spawn on the map, and manifest as usable abilities accessed from the player's [[Deck Zone]].

Decks contain predefined [[Card]]s defined by the player. However, in Quick game modes, all players use the same deck.
